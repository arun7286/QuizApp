# Quiz App in React.js 🎮

This is a simple and interactive quiz application built using **React.js**. The app allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, and tracks their score as they progress. It also includes features like disabling the "Next" button when no option is selected and displaying the score at the end of the quiz. 🎉

## Features ✨

- **Multiple Choice Questions**: The app displays a series of multiple-choice questions with options to select from. ❓
- **Disabling Next Button**: If the user doesn't select an option, the "Next" button remains disabled, preventing the user from moving to the next question until they select an answer. 🚫
- **Score Tracking**: The app keeps track of the user's score as they progress through the quiz. 🏆
- **Quiz Completion**: Once all the questions are answered, the app displays the user's score along with a completion message. 🎯
